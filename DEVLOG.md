## 2025-05-04

### 1. Remote Container Launch Failure
**User Query:** Remote container reopening did not work; only opened a couple of files for editing.
**Action:** Updated `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to change:
```json
-  "dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
+  "dockerComposeFile": ["../docker-compose.yml"],
```
This fixed VS Code's ability to locate the root `docker-compose.yml`.

### 2. Next.js Frontend `NetworkError` Fetching API
**User Query:** Next.js homepage shows `Error: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`
**Guidance:**
- Verified Azure Functions host must be running on port 7071 (`func start`).
- Recommended either:
  - Creating `apps/portal/.env.local` with:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:7071/api
    ```
  - Or using a relative fetch path (`fetch('/api/hello')`) coupled with the `rewrites` rule in `next.config.js` to proxy `/api` to Functions.

### 3. Wrong Container Context for `npm`
**User Query:** Running `npm run start` inside `mssql` container returned `npm: command not found`.
**Explanation:** The SQL Edge container (`mssql`) lacks Node/npm. The Node image is under the `app` service. 
**Guidance:** Use:
```bash
docker-compose exec app bash
```
to enter the Node container where `npm` is available.

### 4. Missing `package.json` in Container Shell
**User Query:** In `app` container shell, `npm --workspace` commands fail because `$PWD` was `/home/node`.
**Action:** Added `working_dir: /workspace` to `app` service in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ...
    working_dir: /workspace
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace:cached
```
This ensures new shells start in `/workspace` (repo root).

### 5. Command to Apply Working Dir Fix
**Guidance:** Recommended either `cd /workspace` manually, or recreate the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate app
``` 
so `working_dir` takes effect.

### 6. Azure Functions Core Tools Not Installed
**User Query:** `npm --workspace=api/functions run start` fails with `func: not found`.
**Action:** Modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` `postCreateCommand` to install Core Tools v4 globally:
```diff
- "postCreateCommand": "npm install --workspace=packages/db && npm install --workspace=apps/portal && npm install --workspace=api/functions"
+ "postCreateCommand": "npm install --workspace=packages/db && npm install --workspace=apps/portal && npm install --workspace=api/functions && npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true"
```
Then ran **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container**.

### 7. Deploy Bicep Script
**User Query:** can you add a script in `scripts` to deploy the `main.bicep` file  
**Action:** Created `scripts/deploy_bicep.sh` to automate Azure CLI deployment of `infra/main.bicep`, with parameters for resource group, location, and optional parameters file.

## 2025-05-06

### 8. Remove Infra Script
**User Query:** ok and can you now create a script to automatically remove all of these resources  
**Action:** Created `scripts/remove_infra.sh` to delete the resource group and purge the Key Vault for full cleanup.

### 9. Deploy Script & Bicep Fixes
**User Query:** fix Bicep warnings/errors and improve redeploy  
**Action:**
- Updated `scripts/deploy_bicep.sh` to accept SQL admin credentials as parameters and pass them to the Bicep deployment.  
- Removed unused `staticLocation` parameter from `infra/main.bicep`.  
- Fixed SQL Database resource in `infra/main.bicep`: added `location`, moved `sku` out of `properties`.  
- Removed unnecessary `dependsOn` from the `webApp` resource in `infra/main.bicep`.

## 2025-05-07

### 10. Fix Deploy Script Bicep Path
**User Query:** Error running `deploy_bicep.sh` â€“ Bicep file not found.  
**Action:** Updated `scripts/deploy_bicep.sh` to derive the absolute path to `infra/main.bicep` using the script directory, ensuring the file is located correctly when run from the `scripts` folder.

## 2025-05-08

### 11. Bicep Param & Vault Naming
**User Query:** BCP334 warning and Key Vault name conflict on redeploy  
**Action:**
- Added `@minLength(3)` decorator to the `location` parameter in `infra/main.bicep` to satisfy the minimum length constraint.  
- Changed Key Vault resource in `infra/main.bicep` to use `uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)` for its name, avoiding name collisions.  
- Added a `keyVaultName` output in `infra/main.bicep` for cleanup and scripting.

### 12. Deploy & Remove Scripts Enhancement
**User Query:** automatically handle deployment naming and vault retrieval for teardown  
**Action:**
- Updated `scripts/deploy_bicep.sh` to include `--name main` on the deployment commands for a stable identifier.  
- Modified `scripts/remove_infra.sh` to auto-fetch the `keyVaultName` from the Bicep deployment outputs when not passed as an argument, simplifying cleanup.

## 2025-05-09

### 13. Remove Infra Script Vault Detection Fix
**User Query:** remove_infra.sh fails to detect Key Vault name for purge
**Action:** Enhanced `scripts/remove_infra.sh` to robustly determine the Key Vault name: try Bicep deployment outputs, fallback to listing active vaults in the resource group, and error if still not found.

## 2025-05-10

### 14. Manage Resource Groups Script
**User Query:** add script to list and delete resource groups interactively  
**Action:** Created `scripts/manage_resource_groups.sh` to list all resource groups in the subscription, present a numbered menu for selection, and issue deletion commands via Azure CLI.

### 15. Contribution Helper Script
**User Query:** add script for colleagues to contribute in the correct GitHub way  
**Action:** Created `scripts/contribute.sh` leveraging GitHub CLI (`gh`) to scaffold feature branches off `main`, guide commits and pushes, and simplify pull request creation.

## 2025-05-11

### 16. Enhanced remove_infra.sh Interactivity
**User Query:** add functionality to list and delete all resources in a resource group and prompt before deleting the group  
**Action:** Refactored `scripts/remove_infra.sh` to:
- Prompt and allow selection of the target Resource Group if not provided.
- List all resources within the group, numbered, with an option to delete all non-Key Vault resources interactively.
- Prompt to delete the Resource Group after resource cleanup.
- Detect and optionally purge Key Vault separately.

## 2025-05-12

### 17. Recovery Services Vault Deletion Handling
**User Query:** remove_infra.sh fails to delete a Recovery Services vault with soft-deleted backup items  
**Action:** Enhanced `scripts/remove_infra.sh` to detect `Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults` resources and delete them using `az backup vault delete`, with warnings if manual purge of backup items is required.
